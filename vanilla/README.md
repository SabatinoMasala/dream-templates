# Diffusers Template

[![Replicate](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/stable-diffusion/badge)](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/stable-diffusion) 

This is an implementation of the [Diffusers Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index) as a template model for Replicate's DreamBooth API. 

- [Cog packages machine learning models as standard containers.](https://github.com/replicate/cog) 
- [Dreambooth API](https://replicate.com/blog/dreambooth-api)

## TODO

- [ ] process / makefile to build them
- [ ] document why there are extra packages - to maximize shared layers (perhaps there can be base and then more?)
- [ ] schedulers?
- [ ] safety_checker missing issues?
